# People Counter Object Detector Using YOLO v8

This project demonstrates a people counter using **Python** and **YOLO v8** for object detection. The system tracks individuals moving on an **escalator**, detecting and counting those going **up** and **down**.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to automate the process of counting people on escalators, identifying the direction they are moving. This is useful for tracking foot traffic in high-traffic areas such as malls, airports, and public transport stations.

## How It Works

1. **YOLO v8 Object Detection**: The system uses the **YOLO v8** model for real-time object detection, identifying people on the escalator.
  
2. **Direction Tracking**: Once a person is detected, their movement is tracked to determine whether they are going **up** or **down** the escalator.

3. **Counting**: The system maintains a count of how many people are moving in each direction.
